            title:"What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?",
            details:`As of my last update in September 2021, there are several ways to manage state in a React application. State management is crucial to maintain and handle the application's data and its changes over time. Here are some of the common state management approaches in React:

            React Component State (Local State): React components can have their own local state managed using the useState hook. This is useful for managing simple, component-specific state that doesn't need to be shared across the application.
            
            Redux: Redux is a popular state management library for React applications. It maintains the entire application's state in a single store and uses a centralized approach for managing state changes. Components can dispatch actions to update the state, and the store then notifies all subscribed components of the state changes.
            
            React Context API: The Context API is built into React and allows you to create a global state accessible to all components within a certain context. It is useful for sharing state between components that are not directly connected through props.
            
            MobX: MobX is another state management library that makes it easy to observe and react to changes in the application's state. It uses observables and reactions to keep components in sync with the state changes.
            
            Apollo Client (with GraphQL): If your React application uses GraphQL for data fetching, Apollo Client can be used for state management. It stores the fetched data and manages it in a normalized cache, making it easy to update and share data across components.
            
            Recoil: Recoil is a relatively newer state management library developed by Facebook. It provides a more flexible and localized approach to state management, where atoms and selectors define and manage state in a more granular manner.
            
            Zustand: Zustand is a minimalistic state management library that uses hooks to manage state in a React application. It provides a simple API and doesn't require much boilerplate code.
            
            UseReducer Hook: Apart from managing state with useState, React's useReducer hook allows you to manage complex state logic in a more structured way, similar to Redux but without the need for an external library.
            
            The choice of state management approach depends on the complexity and requirements of your React application. For small projects, local component state or React's Context API might be sufficient. However, for large and complex applications, libraries like Redux or MobX are often preferred due to their centralized and predictable state management capabilities.`

            title:'How does prototypical inheritance work?',
            details:`Prototypical inheritance is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. In JavaScript, every object has an internal property called the prototype. When you access a property or method on an object, and that property or method doesn't exist on the object itself, JavaScript automatically looks for it in the object's prototype. If the property or method is still not found, it continues the search in the prototype's prototype, forming a chain until it reaches the last prototype in the chain, which is usually the base Object.prototype.

            Here's a basic explanation of how prototypical inheritance works:
            
            Creating Objects: In JavaScript, objects can be created using constructor functions, object literals, or classes (introduced in ES6). Every object is associated with a prototype.
            
            Prototype Link: When an object is created, it has an internal property called [[Prototype]], which points to its prototype. This [[Prototype]] link is what enables prototypical inheritance.
            
            Accessing Properties and Methods: When you try to access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks for it in the object itself. If the property is not found, it looks for it in the object's prototype. This process continues until the property is found or until the end of the prototype chain is reached.
            
            Chaining: If the property is not found in the immediate prototype, JavaScript follows the prototype chain, checking the prototype's prototype, and so on, until it finds the property or reaches the end of the chain.
            
            Base Object.prototype: The final link in the prototype chain is the base object prototype, often denoted as Object.prototype. This object contains common methods and properties that are available to all JavaScript objects.
            
            Inheritance: When an object inherits properties or methods from its prototype, it can use them as if they were defined directly on the object itself. This way, objects can share behavior and functionality through prototypical inheritance.`

            title:`What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?`,
            details:`A unit test is a type of software testing that focuses on testing individual units or components of a software application in isolation. In the context of programming, a unit typically refers to the smallest testable part of an application, such as a function, method, or class. Unit tests are written by developers to verify that each unit of code works as intended and produces the expected output for a given input.

            The primary reasons for writing unit tests are:
            
            Detecting Bugs Early: Unit tests help identify bugs and issues in the early stages of development. By testing individual units in isolation, developers can quickly identify and fix problems before they escalate into larger and more complex issues.
            
            Facilitating Refactoring: When refactoring code, developers can modify and improve the implementation without worrying about breaking existing functionality, as long as the unit tests still pass. This ensures that changes are safer and more manageable.
            
            Maintaining Code Quality: Unit tests act as a safety net, ensuring that the codebase remains stable and reliable over time. They help prevent regressions and ensure that new code doesn't negatively impact existing features.
            
            Improving Code Design: Writing unit tests often forces developers to think about the design of their code in a modular and testable way. This can lead to more organized and maintainable code structures.
            
            Enabling Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD): Unit tests are an essential part of the CI/CD pipeline, where code is automatically built, tested, and deployed. Automated unit tests ensure that code changes meet the required quality standards before integration and deployment.
            
            Enhancing Collaboration: Unit tests serve as documentation for how individual units of code are expected to behave. They make it easier for team members to understand and use each other's code, improving collaboration within the development team.`
